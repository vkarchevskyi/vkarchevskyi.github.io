                <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers. At
                the time it was invented, it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page —
                writing more than a few dozen lines of code would have been somewhat unusual. Due to this, early web
                browsers executed such code pretty slowly. Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web
                developers started using it to create interactive experiences.</p>
            <p>Web browser developers responded to this increased JS usage by optimizing their execution engines
                (dynamic compilation) and extending what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web
                developers use it even more. On modern websites, your browser is frequently running applications that
                span hundreds of thousands of lines of code. This is long and gradual growth of “the web”, starting as a
                simple network of static pages, and evolving into a platform for rich applications of all kinds.</p>
            <p>More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as
                implementing JS servers using node.js. The “run anywhere” nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for
                cross-platform development. There are many developers these days that use only JavaScript to program
                their entire stack!</p>
            <p>To summarize, we have a language that was designed for quick uses, and then grew to a full-fledged tool
                to write applications with millions of lines. Every language has its own quirks — oddities and
                surprises, and JavaScript’s humble beginning makes it have many of these. Some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript’s equality operator (==) coerces its arguments, leading to unexpected behavior:
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>if ("" == 0) {</code>
                <code><span class="comments">// It is! But why??</span></code>
                <code>}</code>
                <code>if (1 < x < 3) {</code>
                <code><span class="comments">// True for *any* value of x!</span></code>
                <code>}</code>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren’t
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>present: const obj={ width: 10, height: 15 }; </code>
                <code><span class="comments">// Why is this NaN? Spelling is hard! </span></code>
                <code>const area=obj.width * obj.heigth;</code>
            </div>
            <p>Most programming languages would throw an error when these sorts of errors occur, some
                would do so during compilation — before any code is running. When writing small programs, such quirks
                are annoying but manageable; when writing applications with hundreds or thousands of lines of code,
                these constant surprises are a serious problem.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="TypeScript">
            <header>
                <h2>TypeScript</h2>
            </header>
            <p>We said earlier that some languages wouldn’t allow those buggy programs to run at all. Detecting errors
                in code without running it is referred to as static checking. Determining what’s an error and what’s not
                based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking.</p>
            <p>TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, it’s
                a static type checker. For example, the last example above has an error because of the type of obj.
                Here’s the error TypeScript found:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>const obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };</code>
                <code>const area = obj.width * obj.<span class="code-error">heigth</span>;</code>
                <code><span class="error">Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you
                    mean 'height'?</span></code>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
            <header>
                <h2>Syntax</h2>
            </header>
            <p>TypeScript is a language that is a superset of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS. Syntax refers
                to the way we write text to form a program. For example, this code has a syntax error because it’s
                missing a ): </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>let a = (4</code>
                <code><span class="error">')' expected.</span></code>
            </div>
            <p>TypeScript doesn’t consider any JavaScript code to be an error because of its syntax. This means you can
                take any working JavaScript code and put it in a TypeScript file without worrying about exactly how it
                is written.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Types">
            <header>
                <h2>Types</h2>
            </header>
            <p>However, TypeScript is a typed superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values
                can be used. The earlier error about obj.heigth was not a syntax error: it is an error of using some
                kind of value (a type) in an incorrect way.</p>
            <p>As another example, this is JavaScript code that you can run in your browser, and it will log a value:
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>console.log(4 / []);</code>
            </div>
            <p>This syntactically-legal program logs Infinity. TypeScript, though, considers division of number by an
                array to be a nonsensical operation, and will issue an error:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>console.log(4 / []);</code>
                <code><span class="error">The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.</span></code>
            </div>
            <p>It’s possible you really did intend to divide a number by an array, perhaps just to see what happens, but
                most of the time, though, this is a programming mistake. TypeScript’s type checker is designed to allow
                correct programs through while still catching as many common errors as possible. (Later, we’ll learn
                about settings you can use to configure how strictly TypeScript checks your code.)</p>
            <p>If you move some code from a JavaScript file to a TypeScript file, you might see type errors depending on
                how the code is written. These may be legitimate problems with the code, or TypeScript being overly
                conservative. Throughout this guide we’ll demonstrate how to add various TypeScript syntax to eliminate
                such errors.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Runtime_Behavior">
            <header>
                <h2>Runtime Behavior</h2>
            </header>
            <p>TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript. For example,
                dividing by zero in JavaScript produces Infinity instead of throwing a runtime exception. As a
                principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.</p>
            <p>This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way,
                even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.</p>
            <p>Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it means
                you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences that might
                make your program stop working.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Erased_Types">
            <header>
                <h2>Erased Types</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Roughly speaking, once TypeScript’s compiler is done with checking your code, it erases the types to
                produce the resulting “compiled” code. This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain
                JS code has no type information.</p>
            <p>This also means that TypeScript never changes the behavior of your program based on the types it
                inferred. The bottom line is that while you might see type errors during compilation, the type system
                itself has no bearing on how your program works when it runs.</p>
            <p>Finally, TypeScript doesn’t provide any additional runtime libraries. Your programs will use the same
                standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs, so there’s no additional
                TypeScript-specific framework to learn.</p>
